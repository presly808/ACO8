1. Interface, Abstract class -> abstract method
	see examples and debug

	search above words in Head First Java book
	pages 195 - 265

   SOLID have to remember by heart

   Design Patterns -> Creational (Singleton,FactoryMethod,Builder)
		   -> Behavioral (Command,Strategy,Observer,TemplateMethod)
	    	   -> Structural (Adapter,Facade,Proxy,Decorator)

   You have to learn first next patterns: Strategy, Observer, Command, Singleton, FactoryMethod
	Use book Head First Design Patterns

2. Debug or visualize all classwork code (dont forget about recursion)

3. Do unfinished tasks

4. implement tasks http://codingbat.com/java/Recursion-1

5. read about Stack and Queue
	see differences

Wish you good week)
